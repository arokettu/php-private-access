A small simple library to access private properties of the objects.
Actually it's more an example of mad skillz than a useful tool.
No Reflection API calls!

## Installation

Use composer:

    composer require sandfoxme/private-access --dev


## Usage

These four simple functions can come in handy as helpers for something like [PsySH]

* `get_private_field()`
* `set_private_field()`
* `call_private_method()`
* `get_private_const()`
